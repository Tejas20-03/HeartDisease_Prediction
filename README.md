# Heart Disease Prediction Model
This machine learning model is designed to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on various risk factors.

### Data
The model was trained on a dataset of patient information, including demographic data and various cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

### Model
The model is a binary classification model built using a supervised machine learning algorithm. It is able to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on their input data.

### Usage
The model can be used by inputting patient information into the model and receiving a prediction of the likelihood of the patient having heart disease.

### Evaluation
The model was evaluated using several common metrics for binary classification models, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set.

### Limitations
It is important to note that this model is only a tool for prediction and should not be used to diagnose heart disease. It is based on a limited dataset and may not be applicable to all patient populations. Further research and clinical validation is needed before the model can be used in a real-world setting.

### Dependencies
Python3
scikit-learn
numpy
pandas
